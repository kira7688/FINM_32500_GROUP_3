# CSV-Based Algorithmic Trading Backtester
Overview
Design and implement a modular Python backtester that reads pre-generated market data from a CSV file, applies trading strategies, executes simulated orders, and produces a performance report. You will practice mutable versus immutable types, object-oriented design with abstract classes and inheritance, container management using lists and dictionaries, and robust exception handling.

Learning Objectives
Parse CSV data into immutable dataclass instances.

Distinguish and use mutable classes for order management.

Build an abstract Strategy interface with concrete subclasses.

Manage time-series data and portfolio state using lists and dictionaries.

Define custom exceptions and handle errors without stopping the backtest.

Generate a Markdown report summarizing key performance metrics.

Task Specifications
Data Ingestion & Immutable Types

Read market_data.csv (columns: timestamp, symbol, price) using the built-in csv module.

Define a frozen dataclass MarketDataPoint with attributes timestamp (datetime), symbol (str), and price (float).

Parse each row into a MarketDataPoint and collect them in a list.

Mutable Order Management

Implement an Order class with mutable attributes: symbol, quantity, price, and status.

Demonstrate in a unit test that you can update Order.status but not MarketDataPoint.price.

Object-Oriented Design

Create an abstract base class:

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Strategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_signals(self, tick: MarketDataPoint) -> list:
        pass
Provide two concrete strategies (e.g., moving average crossover, momentum) that inherit from Strategy.

Encapsulate any internal buffers or indicator values as private attributes (e.g., self._prices, self._window).

Containers for Data & Signals

Buffer incoming MarketDataPoint instances in a list.

Store open positions in a dictionary keyed by symbol: {'AAPL': {'quantity': 0, 'avg_price': 0.0}}.

Collect signals as a list of tuples (action, symbol, qty, price) before converting them to Order objects.

Exception Handling

Define custom exceptions:

class OrderError(Exception): pass
class ExecutionError(Exception): pass
Raise OrderError for invalid orders (e.g., zero or negative quantity).

In the execution engine, simulate occasional failures and raise ExecutionError; catch and log these errors to continue processing.

Execution Engine

Iterate through the list of MarketDataPoint objects in timestamp order.

For each tick:

Invoke each strategy to generate signals.

Instantiate and validate Order objects.

Execute orders by updating the portfolio dictionary.

Wrap order creation and execution in try/except blocks for resilience.

Performance Reporting

After processing all ticks, compute:

Total return

Series of periodic returns

Sharpe ratio

Maximum drawdown

Generate a performance.md report with:

Tables summarizing metrics

An equity-curve plot (e.g., ASCII art or embedded chart link)

A short narrative interpretation of results
